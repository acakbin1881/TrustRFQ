# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-19)

**Core value:** Two parties settle exactly the terms that were signed: atomic on-chain settlement
where a signature over the full economic terms is the integrity boundary.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: On-Chain Maker Discovery (rfq_registry)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (On-Chain Maker Discovery)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-19 - Project initialized from docs ingest (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md,
ROADMAP.md created; 14 v1 requirements mapped across 4 phases)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (all adopted-by-spec, zero ADR-locked).
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- RFQ-D1+D2: auth-entry-native settlement, taker as tx source (proven on Testnet 2026-08-18)
- RFQ-D7: registry stakes native XLM, admin-tunable costs, bounded per-token lists (Phase 1 scope)
- RFQ-D10: broadcast/intent layer stays live until the RFQ protocol ships (Phase 4 gate)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 external dependency: the maker quote server + taker SDK repo (separate repo per spec
  §11) does not exist yet. Phases 1-2 are unblocked (Phase 2 verifies against a local stub maker
  in tools/e2e/); Phase 3 cannot complete until at least one real maker endpoint is live.

- IDX-01 (events indexer) is an open question in the source spec (§10); revisit before or at
  milestone close.

- Standing repo guard: otc_swap wasm hash 83f60b85... must not move; CSP script-src never gains
  'unsafe-inline'; golden vectors are the signature-boundary tripwire.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Contracts | SWAP-02 swap_any open-order entry point | Deferred beyond v1 by source spec | 2026-08-19 |
| Data | IDX-01 events indexer | Open question (spec §10), unscheduled | 2026-08-19 |
